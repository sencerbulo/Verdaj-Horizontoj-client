# To Do...

## Programming
* The main screen doesn't save last user login; add this
* "Settings" screen shows nothing?
* Delete Character isn't implemented
* Characters move really slowly, maybe speed them up
* Make the tile chooser box larger
* Allow tiles to continue being drawn on mouse down, instead of just mouse up
* Move down titlescreen UI to make room for the title text up top
* Hat letter support
